oc-project
A Lua-based GUI menu for games in OpenComputers (Minecraft mod). This script creates an interactive dashboard to browse, sort, and launch games loaded from a JSON file. Features custom drawing with rounded rectangles, shadows, gradients, and event handling for a polished user interface.

Card-Based UI: Displays up to 6 games in a 3x2 grid with details like title, creation date, and playtime.
Interactive Elements: Clickable "Play" buttons, selection highlighting, and bottom action buttons (Refresh, Sort, Theme, Play Selected, Delete, Exit).
Sorting: Toggle between alphabetical (Aâ†’Z) and by creation date.
Theme Switching: Switch between dark and light themes with background images.
